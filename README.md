# JAVASCRIPT PRACTICE CHALLENGE
This project is to practise what we have understood from the lessons we have had in javascript so far

## SET 1
### This set a variety of questions tackling functions , ararys and data type manipulation.
1. Write a function named fizzBuzz that takes in two(2) parameters which are expected to be strings. The function should return the string Fizz if the combined length of the parameters is divisible by 3, the string Buzz if it is divisible by 5, and the string FizzBuzz if it is divisible by both 5 and 3.

2. Write a JavaScript program that prompts a user to enter their year of birth and in turn prints a string in the console stating whether the user is a minor, a youth, or an elder.  Anyone below 18 years is a minor, anyone between 18 and 36 years is a youth and the rest are elders.

3. Write a function named twoSum which takes two parameters: nums and target. Given an array of integer nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

4. Write a function named firstPalindrome which takes a parameter: words. Given an array of string words, return the first palindromic string in the array. If there is no such string, return an empty string "".
A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.

5. Given an integer num, write a function that repeatedly adds all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.

## SET 2
### This set is focusing on arrays and their manipulation.
1. Given an Array containing integers, floats, and one character strings, write a function that takes an Array as a parameter and returns an Object with keys evens, odds, and chars. The value for evens is an array of sorted even numbers, the value for odds is a list of sorted odd numbers and chars is a list of sorted single-character strings.

2. Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

3. Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

4. Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

5. Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".
